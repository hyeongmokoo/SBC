#A global spatial autocorrelation measure with data reliability information 

Assessing spatial autocorrelation (SA) of statistical estimates such as means is a common practice in spatial analysis and statistics. Popular spatial autocorrelation statistics implicitly assume that the reliability of the estimates is irrelevant. Users of these SA statistics also ignore the reliability of the estimates. Current SA statistics tend to overestimate SA when errors of the estimates are not considered. Therefore, when assessing SA of estimates with error, it is essentially comparing distributions in terms of their means and standard errors. Using the concept of the Bhattacharyya coefficient, the Spatial Bhattacharyya coefficient (SBC) is developed. For the significance test, a permutation test is required.
An article related to this development will be shown in The Professional Geographers.
